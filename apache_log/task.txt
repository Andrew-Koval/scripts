Attached is a sample Apache log-file. Using standard command-line tools  (hint: awk, cut, grep, uniq, sort; awk usage for most of the tasks preferred), parse the file to produce the following:

Part 1. Hand-on logs parsing.

   1.  The top 10 IPs making the most requests, displaying the IP address and number of requests made.
   2.  Who is the owner of these IPs. No need to give answer for all, only few.
   3.  Top 10 requested pages and the number of requests made for each.
   4.  Percentage of successful requests.
   5.  Percentage of unsuccessful requests.
   6.  Top 10 unsuccessful page requests.
   7.  The total number of requests made every minute in the time period covered.
   8.  For each of the top 10 IPs, show the top 5 pages requested and the number of requests for each.
   9.  Please explain what you think is going on in this log-file.
   10. Generate an ASCII bar-chart showing the number of requests per minute.

e.g.
2011:06:03 12 ############
2011:06:04 11 ###########

   11. Write a shell script that would do this every hour (run by cron, provide crontab entry) and generate a html report.

Part 2: Pythonista
Do everything above with the python script.
   1. Python script should take filename of log file as argument: (script.py sample_access_log.zip). It should recognize the file type, either it is plain text, zip or gzip.
   2. It should produce html report with all those items above (except the owners).
   3. It should produce report in form of PNG or SVG image which shows the traffic graph for tom 10 IP addresses by time (Y - number of requests, X - time).
